This C program implements a Smart Canteen Billing System designed to handle multiple customers dynamically. It begins by asking the user to input the total number of customers to be served. For each customer, the program displays a fixed menu with item codes and prices, then prompts the customer to enter how many items they wish to order. Using a loop, the program collects item codes and quantities for each order. It uses conditional statements (`if-else`) to match item codes with their respective prices and calculates the total cost for each item. These item totals are added to compute the customer's overall bill. If the total bill exceeds ₹500, a 10% discount is applied. The program then displays an itemized bill including the discount and final amount payable. After processing all customers, the program prints a summary showing the total number of customers served and the total revenue collected by the canteen. The program uses loops for repetition and avoids arrays, functions, or pointers, adhering strictly to the challenge constraints.
